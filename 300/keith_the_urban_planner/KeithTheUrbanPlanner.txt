Keith the Urban Planner

Keith the Knight decided to become urban planner, and he's working on predicting the cost of building a road system to connect the major buildings of the bustling city 
of Plainsboro NJ. 

There is already a set of bidirectional (all non-one-way) roads connecting all the big buildings in the city, but the two most important buildings in this city are the 
School and the House of Edels. Because the path between these two buildings is so important, Keith must pay for the roads that are used to connect them. 
Fortunately for him, he is given a set of distinct positive integer prices, and he has to assign each road a cost that is within the set. No two roads can have the same cost. 

Every road connects two buildings, but every two buildings does not necessarily have a road in between them.
Every road must get a cost, but not every price in the given set will necessarily be used if there are fewer roads connecting the two buildings than prices.

You need to find the lowest cost needed to pay for all the roads needed so that there is a path of roads with costs from the School to the House of Edels. 

You are given two text files. Each row in list.txt corresponds to a building, 
and each row has a number of space-separated integers (each row has a different quantity of these numbers).

The first integer is the I.D of the building. The rest of the numbers in the row are the I.Ds of the buildings that are
directly connected to this building. The I.D of the School is 0, and the I.D of the House of Edels is 19999. 

prices.txt is a list of the possible prices for the roads.
