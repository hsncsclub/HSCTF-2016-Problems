Great Wall of North

High School North recently built a wall around campus to prevent Pirates from entering the building, but they need
to ensure that nobody will climb over it. Therefore, the administration has decided to hire guards to monitor the
outside of the wall. 

There are N applicants for the position of guard, but only a few can be accepted. Each guard j can only monitor the range
in between integers s[j] and f[j] inclusive (you can think of the wall as a number line from 0 to an integer K). Additionally, it's proper etiquette to not monitor a region another guard is monitoring. In other words, no two guards can overlap regions (some of the applicants will overlap in range though).
Each guard j must also be paid p[j] dollars.

You are given a text file where each row has three space-separated integers that correspond to a guard. The first integer
is the s[i], the second is f[i], and the third is p[i].

N = 51500;
K = 31078657

Your goal is to find the minimum amount of money the school has to pay to have every coordinate between 0 and K (inclusive)
monitored.
