Salutations!

Right now, you might be feeling confused, bewildered, or possibly ripped off.
'How can one sentence constitute a problem? I must redress my grievances in a suitable manner!', you might say.

And you'd be absolutely right. 
The reconnaissance series of problems requires you to find a 'flag' that is hidden on the internet,
using only the information in the title of the problem and the name of the person.

For example, the 'flag' might be hidden in a post on a forum, the title of a webpage, or even the source code of a website!
Google will be your best friend.

Good luck!
